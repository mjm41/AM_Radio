# AM Radio Project

This is my custom-built AM radio circuit, designed to pick up local stations. It uses:

- A germanium diode for signal detection.
- A custom LC circuit for tuning.
- An LM386 amplifier for audio output.
- 9V battery for power to audio amplifier.

The result is only about 2 stations with 860 kHz coming in clearest. 

### Highlights
This project came from Chapter 1 of *The Art of Electronics* by Horowitz and Hill. On page 56, they introduced the circuit diagram that highlights the LC circuit.
